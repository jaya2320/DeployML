# DeployML
## Short Description
### What's the problem ?

Most of the time we built a ML model, but it lacks in terms of presentation. The people from non tech background or even sometimes from technical background found it difficult to use.

### How can technology help?

The problem can be solved if we can deploy it in a webapp, which is easy to handle.This repository contains the code for how to deploy an ML model with the help of Django Rest Framework.
You can find the complete guide in the blog written by me:-
